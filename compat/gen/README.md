This directory contains a small tool that generates JSON representations of various API versions,
as captured in the official online
[API Versions Reference](https://vdc-download.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/b50dcbbf-051d-4204-a3e7-e1b618c1e384/538cf2ec-b34f-4bae-a332-3820ef9e7773/api_versions_all_index.html) page.

This extracts version-specific information for each API's set of objects
(existence, deprecation status, FQN).
